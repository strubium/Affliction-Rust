# Affliction
A Better & Safer one, will still steal the exams for you ❤️

## Why have I made Affliction

Back in 2017, I was in a secondary school where teachers use their USB storage (external HDD or a simple Thumbdrive) on computer that serve only to project 
our course. But at some point we understood that they also keeps some juicy information (like exams at the end of the year or future tests). 

## Why did you remake Affliction?

Did you know that more or less the same thing in university :joy: (there is some exception where some teachers will use their personal computer)
